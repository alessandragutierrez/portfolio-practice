            If I had to name a few things in life that inspire me significantly,
            I would say it would consist of creative and imaginative work,
            opportunities to innovate and improve, and the eternal journey of
            being a lifelong learner. These few things are precisely why I was
            drawn to coding.
          <p/>
          <p>
            Within coding, I am given the chance to practice and integrate all
            of those inspirations and more, and put them into full effect. It is
            this process that motivated me to pursue coding, and it is what
            keeps me glued to my screen as I eagerly type away in an attempt
            to get my visions off of my mind and onto the page.
          </p>
          <p>
            Outside of this, I have many interests such as photography,
            cooking & baking, yoga, playing guitar, watching thought-provoking
            films, and reading page-turner novels. I love to solve problems
            and I always welcome a good challenge. I aim to achieve all that
            my mind will possibly allow me to, and I can't wait to see how a
            knowledge in coding can contribute to this, and how it can provide
            me with an outlet for creation, invention, and expression.
